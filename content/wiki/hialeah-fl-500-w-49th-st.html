<b><i>Hialeah, FL (500 W 49th St)</b></i> was a <i>Pizza Time Theatre</i> that opened on December 20, 1982 with a {{< wiki-link "Cyberamics Balcony Stage" >}}, which closed around 1985-1986.
<h2> History </h2>
It opened on December 20, 1982 as a Pizza Time Theatre in the Palm Springs Mile mall in Hialeah Florida. It closed some time around 1985-1986 most likely to financial struggles, which then it was turned into an unknown store, and then a Walgreens, then to a Micheal’s crafts sometime around 2008 where it currently stands. The store that’s currently holds the unit that the PTT was in is a 2 story store which indicates that this was a larger PTT compared to the rest. South Florida wouldn't see another Chuck E. Cheese open until after CU in 1991 at (3805 W 20th Ave) which is still in operation with the 2.0 remodel.
